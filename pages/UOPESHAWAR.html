            <h1 class="abouthead">About university of Peshawar</h1>
            <p class="aboutdetails">In its inaugural year, it had an enrollment of 129, of whom one was a female. The university was founded as an expansion of the Islamia College.
                <br> The founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had visited the college in 1928 had great admiration for it, referring to it as ‘my college’ and adopted it as one of the three heirs to his fortune, along with Aligarh University and Sindh Madrassa (his own school) in 1939.
                <br> For Jinnah the university was a gift to students of the province, in recognition of the part played by them in the making of Pakistan, and how it was the Pashtuns who had fought the Indians and captured Azad Kashmir.
                <br> The University of Peshawar, as a mother educational institution of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is an outcome of the dream of the father of the nation and was created as the first ever University after independence. It is vigorously working with its full zeal and spirit, truly serving and sacred cause of education altogether.
                <br> The University of Peshawar, being a mother Institution of the Khyber Pahtunkhwa is not only catering for the academic needs of Peshawar but also of the whole province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The highly qualified and trained faculty, student friendly and supportive administration, modern curricula, conductive academic environment and excellent infrastructure are the hallmarks of the University. Its role in political, industrial and government leadership is recognized. The University has an over whelming contribution in bringing positive changes in the society.
                <br> In the recent past, a large number of educational institutions have blossomed in the city. There are numerous schools, colleges, professional training institutions, and institutions of higher education. At present there are 15 Universities/ Degree awarding Institutions. The mother educational institution of the city and province is the University of Peshawar, located about 6 km from the city center on the road to the Khyber Pass.
                <br> Beside three major hospitals, a large number of medium and small medical and allied facilities, both in public and private sectors provide medical coverage. Accommodation is available to every type of consumer, starting from a very low to the very expensive, and eating areas are sprinkled all over town offering a variety of cuisines.</p>
